        "description": "I made this app in the summer of 2022. With sports betting recently becoming legal in Ontario, almost every ad on TV and the internet was for a betting app. My friends and I being big sports fans decided to try them out and we all quickly learned that there was a lot more to betting on sports than just liking a team or a player.<br><br> While stuck together in our university house during a pandemic for a whole school year, watching sports and betting became a regular and consistent part of our school lives as we often made jokes and fake bets on each other. <br><br>Once I finished my final exams, I decided I was going to make an app to do all of this for us during the Summer. After 6 days of work, v1.0.0 of Hedge was ready.",
