# allPurpose
> The repository for most of my backend

allPurpose is one of my greatests creations. It's my all-purpose API, a site which provides endpoints for tons of my other projects.

[allPurpose](allpurpose.netlify.com) is also hosted on [my website](jacobtepperman.com), and you can see some of its functions in action [here](jacobtepperman.com/functions).
